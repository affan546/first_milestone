# Super Gym Website

The project is about the gym website .In which the visitors can see the current members views and the facilities available at the gym right now. The website has a responsive menu on the top-right corner of the website .The website has a welcome introductory note on the very first page on the top where its clearly mentioned about location or other information as well.

So, basically this website is for those who are looking for better and good quality of gym services, in this website I tried to cover the most of the required services available at this Gym. From transformation programs to boxing sessions and mixed martial arts services section is there for users to see how can they enjoy those services .I have tried to cover all of the aspects as possible in this website

## Demo

A live Demo can be found here  [Link]( https://affan546.github.io/Gym_Website/)

## UX

## User Stories

As a Gym member, I expect to see the gym membership fees.

As a Visitor, I expect to see the gym main idea and main motto.

## Strategy

My main goal in this design to make it smooth as silk for accessing the information and to understand the website easily .I have tried to make it user friendly.

## Scope

For visitors, I wanted to provide them with a brief overview of the website and gym services and main purpose .This way, they would be able to get a glimpse of who is the gym services for and the background of the gym as well.

## Structure

In the website there are different sections which are defining some kind of action related to our core values like in the first section we do have welcoming page where you can find the land structure and then we have some motivation and our mission section then I have added a section with the extra services we are offering in our website. To provide a better trust to customer I listed the certification section of our trainers. Then I have User review section where our current members have left reviews about our services .In the footer you will find subscription option with social media sharing links.

## Skeleton
Main Page

## Technologies

1. [HTML]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
2. [CSS]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)
3. [BOOTSTRAP]( https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/download/)

## Features

This site uses scroll spy feature in bootstrap for an extra “Smooth Scrolling effect”.

## Features Left to be Implement

In the future, I would like to add further projects that I’ve worked on to create a more comprehensive responsive website. I would love to add progress animation in the project in future.

## Testing

The welcome section is their for visitors to have a better idea of who the gym is for and the location of the building .It includes the information about the equipment and what services the gym is offering like yoga for meditation and there is free parking for the members too .The visitors can view the the programs running by the gym and they can view the social media links as well. They can do that by clicking on the footer link. 

If you try to submit the email subscription with an empty field it will give error for empty field ,there will be an error for empty email address field that means that the user need to add the some valid email address in the field. Once you will add the valid email address in the field it wont give further more errors and will let you get subscribe for the gym services. I haven’t more fields because I wanted to keep it simple.

All Links will open in a new tab ‘target=”_blank”’ and you can view those social media links in the new tabs .All links have been manually tested to ensure that they are pointing to the correct destination.

By clicking on the links in the navbar the scroll spy will effect will work regardless of whether or not you’re viewing the sections in the same order they are listed in the dropdown navbar.

This site was tested across multiple browsers(Chrome,Safari,Internet Explorer,FireFox) on multiple devices(iphone ,Chrome and safari,Samsung galaxy) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.During the testing phase I realized that navbar and welcome page was having a lot of spaces in between that was the main issue I tried to fixed it but it doesn’t seem to be fixed.

## Deployment

This site is hosted using Github pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on Github pages, the landing page must be named index.html 

To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting ```https://github.com/affan546/first_milestone.git``` into your terminal to cut ties with this Github repository , type git remote rm origin into terminal
